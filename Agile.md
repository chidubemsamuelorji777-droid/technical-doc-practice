# Agile and Scrum methodologies
This shows my understanding of the SDLC and how to make a DDLC align with it

### Sprint Documentation Plan (Template)

#### Sprint Overview
1. Sprint Name/Number: [e.g., Sprint 42: "The Login Revamp"]
2. Date Range: [e.g., March 1 – March 14]
3. Primary SME (Subject Matter Expert): [The Lead Developer or Product Owner]

#### User Stories & Doc Impact
Identify which software tasks require documentation updates. Consider the table below:

| User Story ID | Feature Description | Documentation Impact | Priority |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |
| ENG-101 | Add Biometric Login | Update "Security Settings" & "Login" guides. | High |
| ENG-102 | New API Endpoint: `/user/profile` | Update API Reference & Postman collection. | Medium |
| ENG-105 | UI Color Change | Screenshot updates only. | Low |

3. The DDLC Workflow (2-Week Sprint)
Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Days 1–2)
Goal: Attend Sprint Planning.

Tasks: * [ ] Review mockups/Figma files.

[ ] Define the scope: Is this a new page or a paragraph update?

[ ] Create "Doc Tasks" in the team's project board (e.g., Jira or Trello).

Phase 2: Drafting & Development (Days 3–7)
Goal: Write while the developers code.

Tasks: * [ ] Draft initial content based on requirements.

[ ] Interview the developer (SME) for technical nuances.

[ ] Draft "Placeholder" screenshots if the UI isn't ready.

Phase 3: Review & Validation (Days 8–9)
Goal: Ensure accuracy.

Tasks: * [ ] Technical Review: Have the developer check for factual errors.

[ ] Editorial Review: Peer review for grammar and style.

[ ] Doc QA: Test the instructions against the "Staging" environment.

Phase 4: Finalize & Publish (Day 10)
Goal: Sync with the Software Release.

Tasks: * [ ] Replace placeholders with final screenshots.

[ ] Push docs to the live site/Help Center.

[ ] Attend the Sprint Review to show off the completed docs.

4. Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist
A story is only "Done" when:

[ ] Content is technically verified by an engineer.

[ ] Links and formatting are checked.

[ ] Screenshots reflect the final UI.

[ ] The documentation is merged/published.

How to use this as a Technical Writer
In your next meeting, when a developer says, "I'm done with the code," you can use this template to show that the feature isn't actually "Done" until your documentation is validated. It gives you a seat at the table!

Digital globalisation has led to increased cybersecurity threats. 
Organisations have a greater liability due to their possession of sensitive and personal data.
However, the advancement in cybersecurity technology now makes up for that liability.

The following are tools used by organisations to monitor and combat potential threats to data:

#### Intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS)

Used for monitoring and/or blocking potential threats. An example is: 
- [**Suricata**](https://suricata.io/): Both an IDS and IPS tool. Popular for easy use and versatile features.  
   It is able to:
    - Create and run custom rules for monitoring traffic.
    - Monitor traffic captured in a .pcap file.
    - Examined the fast.log and eve.json output of any threat detection tool.

#### Security information and event management (SIEM) tools

Used for analyzing log data in real time and responding to threats. Examples include:
- [**Splunk cloud**](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/splunk-cloud-platform.html): This is a cost-effective SIEM tool. The infrastrusture management is handled by Splunk. A cloud-based version of Splunk Enterprise. On it you can:

#### Other cybersecurity tools that can be combined with the above to improve security infrastructure include:
| Tool type | Example | Primary Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint detection and response | CrowdStrike falcon | Monitors end-user devices |
| Vulnerability scanner | Tenable Nessus | Scans and identifies security gaps and risks |
| Identity and access management | Okta | Manages user identities |
| Penetration testing | Metasploit | Simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities |

Organisations may need to use more or less of the tools mentioned here depending on the size of the establishment. 
Hence, it is important to seek the services of a qualified cybersecurity consultant.

### Cybersecurity Tools

Digital globalisation has led to increased cybersecurity threats. 
Both organisations and individuals have a role to play in combating potential threats. 
Organisations have a greater liability due to their possession of sensitive and personal data. 

The following are tools used by organisations to monitor and combat potential threats to data:

#### Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)

Used for monitoring and/or blocking potential threats. An example is: 
- **Suricata**: This is both an IDS and IPS tool. It is very popular for easy usage and versatility.  
   It is able to:
    - Create and run custom rules for monitoring traffic.
    - Monitor traffic captured in a .pcap file.
    - Examined the fast.log and eve.json output of any threat detection tool.

#### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

Used for analyzing log data in real time and responding to threats. Examples include:
- **Splunk Cloud**: is a cost-effective SIEM tool. It is a cloud-based version of Splunk Enterprise. The infrastrusture management is handled by Splunk. On it you can:
  - Upload log data.
  - Search through indexed data.
  - Evaluate search results.
  - Identify different data sources.
  - Locate failed SSH logins.
- **Google Security Operations**: Also known as Google SecOps. It is a Google cloud-hosted SIEM tool designed to speedily analyze and remedy threats. On it you can:
  - Access threat intelligence reports on a domain.
  - Identify the assets that accessed the domain.
  - Evaluate HTTP events associated with a domain.
  - Identify which assets submitted login information to the domain.
  - Identify additional domains.

Other cybersecurity tools that can be combined with the above to improve security infrastructure include:
| Tool type | Example | Primary Function |
| :-------- | :------ | :---------- |
| Endpoint Detection and Response | CrowdStrike Falcon | Monitors end-user devices |
| Vulnerability Scanner | Tenable Nessus | Scans and identifies security gaps and risks |
| Identity and Access Management | Okta | Manages user identities |
| Penetration Testing | Metasploit | Simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities |

Organisations may need to use more or less of the tools mentioned here depending on the size of the establishment. 
Hence, it is important to seek the services of a qualifies cybersecurity consultant.
